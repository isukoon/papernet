            <p>The Internet is rapidly becoming an important source of news and 
              information for people. Because an increasing number of people have 
              the ability to access the Internet on a regular basis, the Web now 
              rivals more traditional media sources, such as print media and television, 
              as a source for daily news. The evolution of the Internet as a news 
              source is so dramatic that it is partly responsible for the significant 
              decline in circulation and audience experienced by print media.</p>
            <p>Publishing an advertisement in a newspaper is a time consuming 
              task where the publisher have to go to a newspaper company or an 
              agent to publish there advertisement. It takes time where the publisher 
              have to wait in the queues until he get the chance.</p>
            <p>PaperNET is an On-Line Newspaper Advertisement submition system 
              where users can submit there newspaper advertisements on-line to 
              the newspaper company with in Sri Lanka from all over the world.</p></td>
